        <h1>Hey! I'm Atharva</h1>
        <p>
            I'm an 8th grader who loves coding and creating cool stuff! I'm learning Full-Stack Development and Python,
            and I’m always exploring how websites, apps, and games work. 
            When I’m not building things,
            you’ll probably find me playing video games or diving into something new just for the fun of it.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an 8th grader who loves coding, building websites, and figuring out how things work. I’m learning Full-Stack Development and Python, and I’m always exploring new tech just for fun. When I’m not coding,
          I’m probably gaming, creating stuff, or learning something random and cool. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m learning full-stack web development, starting with HTML, CSS, Python, and GitHub.
             I enjoy designing websites and learning how the internet works behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like coding because, I'm able to create and innovate by myself, If I can imagine it, I 
            can also make it. That is what draws me to coding and to learn how build it all myself.

            This was my first web development project where I built and deployed my own portfolio website using only HTML and CSS.
            I learned how to structure and style web pages, apply good design principles, and publish my work online using GitHub Pages.<br><br>
