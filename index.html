        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Atharva Jha, an 8th-grade student with a deep passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation.
           I’m currently exploring web development and programming through courses from Infosys.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m learning full-stack web development, starting with HTML, CSS, Python, and GitHub.
             I enjoy designing websites and learning how the internet works behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like coding because, I'm able to create and innovate by myself, If I can imagine it, I 
            can also make it. That is what draws me to coding and to learn how build it all myself.

            This was my first web development project where I built and deployed my own portfolio website using only HTML and CSS.
            I learned how to structure and style web pages, apply good design principles, and publish my work online using GitHub Pages.
